```

## Usage (Functions in 'main.py')

The program can take in a definite path of foler holding lyrics in txt files.
It can be executable as a single command. 
The input to your command should be the path to the directory holding the song files. 
The output of your command should be a JSON object (sent to standard out, StdOut) that contains a list of characterizations; one for each song. 
Each characterization object should have the listed dimensions (keys) and a values for how well the song fits into that dimension. 

Dimensions
    kid_safe: no bad words
        0 is not kid safe
        1 is very kid safe
    love: is it a love song? 
        0 is not a love song
        1 is a love song
    mood: Upbeat, has a positive message
        0 is a dark song
        1 is a very happy song
    length: how long is it
        0 is a short song
        1 is a very long song
    complexity: requires high level of vocabulary to understand
        0 is a very simple song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdMTl9zHQ9Y
